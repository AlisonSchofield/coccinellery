This directory is used for adding your semantic patches to Coccinellery.
Create a directory for you and put all semantic patches inside your directory.

For each .cocci file, please create a .desc file. There are examples of .desc
files on the repository.

If you want a new target, change the targets file on the root directory of the
repository and fill the coccinellery-target line on the .desc file.
