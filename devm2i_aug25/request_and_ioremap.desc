The various devm_ functions allocate memory that is released when a driver
detaches.  This patch uses these functions for data that is allocated in
the probe function of a platform device and is only freed in the remove
function.

The initial call to platform_get_resource is moved down to the introduced
call to devm_request_and_ioremap thta uses its result.
