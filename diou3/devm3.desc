devm free functions should not have to be explicitly used.
The only thing left that is useful in the function mpc5121_nfc_free is the
call to clk_disable, which is moved to the call sites.
This function also incorrectly called iounmap on devm_ioremap allocated

Use devm_request_and_ioremap in place of devm_request_mem_region and
devm_ioremap.
Use devm_clk_get.
