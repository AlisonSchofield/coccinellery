This patch extends 42a6e66f1e40a930d093c33ba0bb9d8d8e4555ed by using
usb_endpoint_xfer_control, usb_endpoint_xfer_isoc, usb_endpoint_xfer_bulk,
and usb_endpoint_xfer_int in the negated case as well.
This patch also rewrites some calls to usb_endpoint_dir_in as negated calls
to !usb_endpoint_dir_out, and vice versa, to better correspond to the
intent of the original code.
