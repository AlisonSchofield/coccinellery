The function framebuffer_release just calls kfree, so calling kfree
subsequently on the same argument represents a double free.  The
comments with the definition of framebuffer_release
in drivers/video/fbsysfs.c suggest that a more elaborate definition of this
function is planned, such that the splitting up of framebuffer_release and
kfree as done in the second instance might someday make sense, but it does
not make sense now.
