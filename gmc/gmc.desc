genlmsg_cancel subtracts some constants from its second argument before
calling nlmsg_cancel.  nlmsg_cancel then calls nlmsg_trim on the same
arguments.  nlmsg_trim tests for NULL before doing any computation, but a
NULL second argument to genlmsg_cancel is no longer NULL due to the initial
subtraction.  Nothing else happens in this execution, so the call to
genlmsg_cancel is simply unnecessary in this case.
