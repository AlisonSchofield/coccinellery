nf_conntrack_alloc cannot return NULL, so there is no need to check for
NULL before using the value.  I have also removed the initialization of ct
to NULL in nf_conntrack_alloc, since the value is never used, and since
perhaps it might lead one to think that return ct at the end might return
NULL. This semantic patch detect candidates for the changes.
