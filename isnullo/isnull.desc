Add a new variable for storing resources accessed subsequent to the one
accessed using request_mem_region, so the one accessed using
request_mem_region can be released if needed.

The resource variable names are also changed to be more descriptive.

This code is also missing some calls to iounmap.

The semantic match that finds this problem is as follows:
(http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/)

// <smpl>
@r@
expression E, E1;
identifier f;
statement S1,S2,S3;
@@

if (E == NULL)
{
  ... when != if (E == NULL || ...) S1 else S2
      when != E = E1
*E->f
  ... when any
  return ...;
}
else S3
// </smpl>
