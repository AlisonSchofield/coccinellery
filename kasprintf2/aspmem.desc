Rewrite the initialization of a dev field.  In the original code, in each
case there was a kmalloc followed by a memcpy, as illustrated by the
semantic patch below.  In the case that the provided string was the empty
string, the allocated memory was then overwritten with a constant string,
causing a memory leak.  Finally, there was no provision for returning
-ENOMEM in case of failure of the memory allocation.  Indeed, the return
value in an error case was err, a variable that was never initialized to
anything other than 0.
The following patch rewrites the above code to first select a string based
on various conditions, and then to copy it into a newly allocated memory
region, using kstrdup.  This decreases subtantially the code size
and removes the memory leak.  The instruction for getting the length of the
string and the associated variable declaration are also deleted.
The patch also drops err, changes the return value to retval, which in each
file was already initialized elsewhere to an error code, and initializes
retval to -ENOMEM when kstrdup fails.
