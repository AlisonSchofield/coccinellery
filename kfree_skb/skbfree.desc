When values of type struct sk_buff * are freed from within an interrupt
handler, dev_kfree_skb_irq should be used rather than kfree or kfree_skb.

In most of the cases below, the function containing the free ends up as a
URB completion callback.  Such callbacks are called from an interrupt
handler.  In drivers/bluetooth/btsdio.c, the enclosing function is
ultimately referenced from the second argument of sdio_claim_irq, which is
also used as an interrupt handler.
