In this code, blkvsc_req is allocated in the cache blkdev->request_pool,
but freed in the first case to the cache blkvsc_req->dev->request_pool.
blkvsc_req->dev is subsequently initialized to blkdev, making these the
same at the second call to kmem_cache_free.  But at the point of the first
call, blkvsc_req->dev is NULL.  The second call is changed too, for
uniformity.
