If list_for_each_entry, etc complete a traversal of the list, the iterator
variable ends up pointing to an address at an offset from the list head,
and not a meaningful structure.  Thus this value should not be used after
the end of the iterator.  Replace c->dev by dev, which is the value that
c->dev has been compared to.
