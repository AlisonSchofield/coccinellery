of_iomap calls ioremap, and so should be matched with an iounmap.  At the
two error returns, the result of calling of_iomap is only stored in a local
variable, so these error paths need to call iounmap.  Furthermore, this
function ultimately stores the result of of_iomap in an array that is local
to the file.  These values should be iounmapped at some point.  I have
added a corresponding call to iounmap at the end of the function m8xx_remove.
