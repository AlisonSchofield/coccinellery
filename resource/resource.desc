Request_region should be used with release_region, not release_resource.

The result of request_mem_region is no longer stored.  Instead the field
ioarea is used to store a pointer to the resource structure that contains
the start address.  This is the information that is needed later in
nuc900_i2c_remove to release the region.  The field ioarea is also printed
in some debugging code.
