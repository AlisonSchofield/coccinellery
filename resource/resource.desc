Request_region should be used with release_region, not release_resource.

The result of request_mem_region is no longer stored.  Instead the field
ioarea is used to store a pointer to the resource structure that contains
the start address.  This is the information that is needed later in
i2c_au1550_remove to release the region.  The field ioarea is not used for
anything else.

The semantic match that finds this problem is as follows:
(http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/)

// <smpl>
@@
expression x,E;
@@
(
*x = request_region(...)
|
*x = request_mem_region(...)
)
... when != release_region(x)
    when != x = E
* release_resource(x);
// </smpl>
