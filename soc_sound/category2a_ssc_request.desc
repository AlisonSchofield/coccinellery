The test (ssc != NULL) can only be reached if the call to the function
ssc_request, the result of which ssc is assigned, succeeds. Moreover,
two statements assign NULL to ssc just before a return, which is useless
since it is a local variable. So, we suggest to delete the test and
the two assignments.
