The function x25_get_neigh increments a reference count.  At the point of
the second goto out, the result of calling x25_get_neigh is only stored in
a local variable, and thus no one outside the function will be able to
decrease the reference count.  Thus, x25_neigh_put should be called before
the return in this case.
