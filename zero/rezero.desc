The file drivers/media/video/tvaudio.c contains the following code:
(starting at line 1257 in a recent linux-next)
                if (mode & V4L2_TUNER_MODE_MONO)
                        s1 |= TDA8425_S1_STEREO_MONO;
                if (mode & V4L2_TUNER_MODE_STEREO)
                        s1 |= TDA8425_S1_STEREO_SPATIAL;
(starting at line 1856 in a recent linux-next)
        if (mode & V4L2_TUNER_MODE_MONO)
                vt->rxsubchans |= V4L2_TUNER_SUB_MONO;
        if (mode & V4L2_TUNER_MODE_STEREO)
                vt->rxsubchans |= V4L2_TUNER_SUB_STEREO;
The only possible value of V4L2_TUNER_MODE_MONO, however, seems to be 0, as
defined in include/linux/videodev2.h, and thus the first test in each case
is never true.  Is this what is intended, or should the tests be expressed
in another way?
